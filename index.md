# Everyting running Kubernetes on Aarch64/ARM64

Project31 aims to deploy the Fabric8 applications on Aarch64 (ARM64) architectures, in particular a cluster of RaspberryPi3 and Pine64.

## 1. Install a base Centos-7 on your ARM64 hardware of choice

* Install [Centos-7 Aarch64 on Pine64](/pine64/)

Repeat step one until all nodes are up and running.

## 2. Install Docker and Kubernetes 1.3 on your centos-7 cluster

These instructions should work for any base centos-7 installation regardless of the chip architecture.
