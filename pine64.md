# Install Centos-7 to Pine64

The Pine64 board should be able to run Aarch64/ARM64 images. The official Centos-7 supports these 
images at <http://mirror.centos.org/altarch/7/isos/aarch64/>. Unfortunately currently that kernel does
not run as is in Pine64. However there are really great instructions by [Uli Middelberg]
(https://github.com/umiddelb/aarch64/wiki/Install-CentOS-7-on-your-favourite-ARMv8-ARM64-AArch64-board) how to
fix this. Alternative you can download a ready to go image from [mypine64.com]
